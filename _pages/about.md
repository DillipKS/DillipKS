I work in the field of Text Analytics and NLP, applying various Machine Learning & Deep Learning algorithms on large scale text data to extract information and provide intelligent insight. I graduated from IIT Madras with B.Tech in Aerospace Engineering. I joined PhD in Computer Science IIT Delhi, but dropped out and joined industry. I wish to complete my PhD in Machine Learning at some point in the future.

With 1+ year of industry experience in Data Science with focus on NLP, Text Analytics, I have worked on Text Classification, Topic Detection, Audio Denoising & Knowledge Graph. I do data modelling & visualization, obtain statistical insight from data and deploy ML/DL models in production environments.
Having strong technical foundation in Mathematics, I am also fluent in Python, C++, Scikit-Learn, Tensorflow, Gensim, CoreNLP, Neo4J (Graph DB), and work in Linux. I have also completed 'CS224n: NLP with Deep Learning' course online by Stanford University. 
I am eager to learn tools like Hadoop, Spark, Scala, Cassandra, etc. to build scalable data processing systems. I am a swift learner and like to analyze things critically.
I also do ethical hacking as a hobby. When not immersed into data, I explore the fields of Cybersecurity and Blockchain.
