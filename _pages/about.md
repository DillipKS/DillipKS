I am a data scientist with specific interests in the areas of Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Text Mining.
I am excited to apply for Data Scientist role. With 1+ year of industry experience in Data Science with focus on NLP, Text Analytics, I have worked on Text Classification, Topic Detection, Audio Denoising & Knowledge Graph. I do data modelling & visualization, obtain statistical insight from data and deploy ML/DL models in production environments.
Having strong technical foundation in Mathematics, I am also fluent in Python, C++, Scikit-Learn, Tensorflow, Gensim, CoreNLP, Neo4J (Graph DB), and work in Linux. I have also completed 'NLP with DL' course online by Stanford Univ. 
I am eager to learn tools like Hadoop, Spark, Scala, Cassandra, etc. to build scalable data processing systems. I am a swift learner and like to analyze things critically.
I also do ethical hacking as a hobby. When not immersed into data, I explore the fields of Cybersecurity and Blockchain.
