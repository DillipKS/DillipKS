# H1 Heading

## H2 Heading

### H3 Heading

Here's some basic text.

And some *italics*

Some **bold** stuff.

What about a [link](github.com)

Bulleted list:
* One
+ two
- Three

Numbered list:
1. A
2. B
3. C

Python code block:
```
    python
        import numpy as np

        def test(x, y):
            z = np.sum(x,y)
            return z
```

Some inline code `x+y`.

Images:
<img src="{{ siteba.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/perceptron/neural_network.png" alt="basic neural network">

Here's some math:

$$z=x+y$$

You can also put it inline $$z=x+y$$
